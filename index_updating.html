			I am now a postdoctoral Research Fellow in the research group of Professor Yang Liu, and focusing primarily on the areas of mobile security, AI model robustness, software development and testing, and big data. I received my Ph.D. degree in East China Normal University (ECNU), Shanghai, China, in June 2019, under the superivsion of Professor Lihua Xu (NYU Shanghai). I also had been a Research Assistant at SCSE of NTU (October 2016-June 2019). I received an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ICSE 2018 and won Research Tool Award at NASAC 2018 held by CCF.</br>-->

			Android Malware: I worked on Android malware detection and classification (<strong>StormDroid</strong>) using machine learning (both static and dynamic features with statistical metrics) (refer to ASIACCS'16). 
            I've developed <strong>KuafuDet</strong> (MobiCom'16, COSE'17, SANER-AI4Mobile'18) for Android malware detection using machine learning in adversarial environment. We examine how machine-learning classifiers (e.g., DroidAPIMiner, DREBIN, and MaMaDroid) can be misled under different threat models.
        	</p>
        	<p style="text-align:justify">
        	Android Vulnerability: I worked on security app vulnerability detection (<strong>A<font size="4">USERA</font></strong>) in security-critical FinTech applications (e.g., mobile banking apps and payment apps). We investigated the characteristics of these vulnerabilities, and the changing trend over time (refer to ESEC/FSE'18, TDSC'19).
        	</p>
        	<p style="text-align:justify">
        	Android App Development: We proposed a system, <strong>StoryDroid</strong> (refer to ICSE'19), to automatically generate the storyboard for Android apps, and assist different roles to review apps efficiently. Specifically, it extracts the activity transition graph and leverages static analysis techniques to render UI pages to visualize the storyboard with the rendered pages. The mapping relations between UI pages and the corresponding implementation code (e.g., layout code, activity code, and method hierarchy) are also provided to users. Such a storyboard benefits different roles (i.e., PMs, UI designers, and developers) in the app development process.
        	</p>

        	<p style="text-align:justify">
		Android App Analysis/Testing: We conducted a large-scale empirical study to characterize framework-specific exceptions in Android apps, and implemented <strong>ExLocator</strong> (refer to ICSE'18), an exception localization tool, for Android applications. We proposed <Strong>APEChecker</Strong> (refer to ASE'18), a technique to efficiently manifest aysnc programming errors (APEs) in Android apps.
